# dealmonitor_ml
The ML Model to power the dealmonitor as well as the training and stuff.

## Run a training session
Because training takes time and ssh tends to stop processes when the connection times out, it is wisely recommended to use a tmux
training session.

```bash
tmux new -s training_session
# Starte Trainings script, e. g.:
python train_nn_model.py
```

detach training session using 'ctrl + b' and afterwards 'd'

reattach session using:
```bash
tmux attach -t training_session
```

## Including the Dealmonitor Repository as a Submodule
This project uses Git submodules to include the Dealmonitor repository within the dealmonitor_ml project. Git submodules allow you to keep a separate repository as a subdirectory in your project while maintaining independent versioning.

### Adding the Submodule
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your dealmonitor_ml repository.

2. Add the Dealmonitor repository as a submodule (replace the URL with the actual URL of your dealmonitor repo):
```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:rwkaspar/dealmonitor.git dealmonitor
```
This will create a folder named dealmonitor containing the Dealmonitor repository.

3. Commit the changes:
```bash
git add .gitmodules dealmonitor
git commit -m "Add Dealmonitor repository as a submodule"
```

### Cloning the Repository with Submodules
When cloning this repository for the first time, you need to initialize and fetch the submodules separately:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dealmonitor_ml.git
cd dealmonitor_ml
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
This ensures the Dealmonitor submodule contents are also downloaded.

### Updating the Submodule
To pull new changes from the Dealmonitor submoduleâ€™s remote repository:

```bash
cd dealmonitor
git pull origin main
cd ..
git add dealmonitor
git commit -m "Update Dealmonitor submodule"
```
Using Git submodules keeps the Dealmonitor repository cleanly separate but integrated into the ML project, allowing independent version control and easier maintenance.
